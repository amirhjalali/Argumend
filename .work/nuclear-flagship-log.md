# Nuclear Flagship — Autonomous Loop Work Log

Goal: build the Nuclear flagship user-journey experience per
`docs/plans/2026-06-22-nuclear-flagship-journey-design.md`, then continue broader
Argumend improvement. Self-paced loop. Verify every change (tsc + vitest + routes),
commit incrementally, **do not push**.

Branch: `nuclear-flagship` (off `main`).

---

## Pacing notes (data-driven — I CAN read real usage)
- Real numbers live at `/tmp/claude/statusline-usage-cache.json` (monclaude refreshes
  every ~180s via the OAuth `/api/oauth/usage` endpoint). Read `.five_hour.utilization`,
  `.five_hour.resets_at`, `.seven_day.utilization`, `.seven_day.resets_at`.
- TWO windows: **5h rolling = rate cap** (keep < 80%); **7d = budget envelope to spend**
  (was 12% used at start, resets ~2026-06-24T02:00Z — the founder's "1d 19h" reset).
- Policy: 5h < 70% → full speed, big chunks, ~60s sleeps. 70–80% → stretch sleeps.
  ≥ 80% → sleep until `five_hour.resets_at`, then resume. Burn the weekly down meanwhile.
- One meaningful, verified, committed chunk per iteration.

## Iteration log

### Iter 0 — 2026-06-22 — Phase 0 (design + setup)
- Assessed repo: 142 topics, 57 blog posts, 19 guides; tsc clean; 207 tests green.
- Found + parked the breadth play: 132/142 topics lack an `/is/` AEO page (scoped, batched).
- Founder redirect → depth on one flagship topic. Chose **nuclear-energy-safety**.
- Mapped current Read-Mode journey; identified 3 gaps (buried wow, no crisp atomic
  facts w/ confidence, crux is "what settles it" not "what would change your mind").
- Wrote design doc (5-stage journey + falsification crux model + phased plan).
- Created branch, work log. Baseline verified.
- **Next:** Phase 1 — additive schema (`CruxSchema.falsification`,
  `Topic.keystone_fact`, `Topic.simple_case`); confirm all 142 topics still validate.

### Iter 1 — 2026-06-22 — Phases 1 + 2 (schema + nuclear content)
- Discovered I can read real usage (monclaude cache) → switched to data-driven pacing.
  5h was 7–8% throughout (huge headroom); old 20-min naps were far too slow.
- Phase 1: added optional `CruxSchema.falsification`, `Topic.keystone_fact`,
  `Topic.simple_case`. tsc clean; 207 tests pass (all topics still validate).
- Phase 2: authored nuclear `keystone_fact`, `simple_case`, and falsification for both
  pillars (safety; climate-effectiveness). tsc clean; 207 tests pass. Committed `1ebc7a3`.
- **Next:** Phase 3 — `FalsificationCrux` component + atomic-fact confidence tiers,
  wired into `ReadModeView` gated on data presence (no regression for other topics).

### Iter 2 — 2026-06-22 — Phase 3 (falsification crux + atomic-fact tiers)
- `confidenceTier()` helper; `FalsificationCrux` component (gated on `crux.falsification`,
  falls back to the old test view); `EvidenceItem` now shows tier + "% confidence".
- Wired into `ReadModeView`. tsc clean; 207 tests; eslint clean; **full production
  build passed** and nuclear HTML verified to contain the falsification + confidence
  content. Committed `2a34dd7`. 5h usage ~9%.
- **Next:** Phase 4 — render Stage-1 keystone hero (`topic.keystone_fact`) above the
  claim + Stage-2 `simple_case`, gated on presence so other topics are unaffected.

### Iter 3 — 2026-06-22 — Phase 4 (keystone hero + simple case)
- `FlagshipIntro` component (Stage 1 keystone fact w/ confidence pill + Stage 2
  simple case), wired into `ReadModeView` above the claim, gated on data.
- tsc clean; 207 tests; eslint clean; **build passed**. Verified nuclear HTML shows
  hero + simple case + "90% confidence"; rent-control HTML has NO keystone block
  (gating correct, no regression). Committed `52fa6f9`. 5h ~9%.
- **Full Stage 1–5 journey now live for nuclear.**
- **Next:** Phase 6 — tests (confidenceTier unit test; nuclear data-integrity test
  for keystone_fact/simple_case/falsification; component render+gating tests).
  Then Phase 5 polish (copy, a11y, mobile, dark mode, reduced-motion, visual QA),
  then Phase 7 roll-out to 2–3 more empirical topics.

### Iter 4 — 2026-06-22 — Phase 6 (tests)
- `lib/schemas/flagship.test.ts` (confidenceTier boundaries; falsification + keystone/
  simple_case schema accept/reject; nuclear data-integrity).
- `components/FlagshipIntro.test.tsx` + `components/FalsificationCrux.test.tsx`
  (render-when-present + gating/fallback). First .test.tsx files in the repo.
- 221 tests pass (+14); tsc + eslint clean. Committed `7ee0eae`. 5h ~10%.
- **Next:** Phase 5 — verify the DEFAULT topic landing view shows the flagship intro
  (not hidden behind the read/graph toggle), then visual QA via dev-server screenshot,
  then polish (a11y, mobile, dark mode, reduced-motion). Then Phase 7 roll-out.

### Iter 5 — 2026-06-22 — Phase 5 (verify default view + visual QA)
- Confirmed topic page DEFAULTS to read view (`?view=graph` opt-in), so FlagshipIntro
  is the first thing a visitor sees. Positioning correct.
- Dev server (`:3007`) + Playwright screenshots: desktop light, desktop dark, mobile
  (390px) all render the keystone hero + "Established · 90% confidence" pill + simple
  case cleanly and on-brand. Wow lands; dark + mobile good; a11y labels present; no
  animations (reduced-motion N/A).
- **No code changes** — implementation already polished (honest QA outcome).
- **Pre-existing (NOT mine):** React hydration-mismatch warning on ALL topic pages
  (verified on rent-control too) + GA-blocked-by-CSP + favicon 404 in local dev.
  Out of scope for the flagship; flagged for a separate look.
- Cleaned up dev artifacts. 5h ~11%.
- **Next:** Phase 7 — roll the flagship pattern (keystone_fact, simple_case,
  falsification cruxes) to 2–3 more strong empirical topics:
  rent-control-effectiveness, death-penalty-deterrence, gmo-crops-safety.
