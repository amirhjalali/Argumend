# Argumend Funding Strategy (Reference)

*Saved from research session — Feb 2026. Revisit when ready to pursue funding.*

## Model: Nonprofit with "Fund an Analysis" Mechanic

### Revenue Structure (Target)
| Source | Target % | Notes |
|--------|----------|-------|
| "Fund an Analysis" donations | 25% | $10-50 per analysis, community sets agenda |
| Foundation grants | 40% | Templeton, Mozilla, Knight, New Pluralists |
| Corporate AI partnerships | 15% | Anthropic 75% discount, Microsoft compute |
| Institutional licenses (edu) | 20% | Schools, newsrooms, civic orgs |

### Legal Path
1. **Immediate**: Fiscal sponsorship (accepts tax-deductible donations in weeks)
2. **12-18 months**: File 501(c)(3) (required for major foundation grants)

### "Fund an Analysis" Tiers
| Tier | Price | Output |
|------|-------|--------|
| Quick Analysis | $10-15 | Single-model, basic steel-manning |
| Full Analysis | $25-50 | 3-judge council, evidence weighting, verdict card |
| Deep Dive | $100-250 | Full analysis + AI debate + updates |

### Immediate Actions (When Ready)
1. Apply to Anthropic Claude for Nonprofits (75% API discount)
2. Apply to Mozilla Democracy x AI incubator
3. Submit Templeton Foundation funding inquiry
4. Join Bridge Alliance network (free, gets visibility with funders)
5. Set up fiscal sponsorship
6. Build impact measurement (pre/post user surveys)

### Realistic Trajectory
| Year | Revenue | Source |
|------|---------|-------|
| 1 | $50-100K | Small grants + community donations |
| 2-3 | $200-500K | Foundation grants + growing donations |
| 5 | $500K-2M | Diversified (grants + licenses + donations) |

### API Economics
- Cost per 3-judge analysis: ~$0.07 (declining 50-80%/yr)
- At 100K users: $168-480K/yr API costs
- Anthropic nonprofit discount cuts this to ~$0.02/analysis

### Key Insight
Every successful civic tech nonprofit diversified revenue. Pure donations
alone have never sustained an AI product at scale. The "fund an analysis"
mechanic is the differentiator — it ties donations to concrete output.
